These code written to compute the square root of integers 
which excludes a non-negative integers.Since the return type is an integer, 
the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.
The Time complexity O(log(N):Logarithmic running time ( O(log n) ) essentially means that the running time
grows in proportion to the logarithm of the input size.
Space complexity:In short, O(1) means that it takes a constant time, like 14 nanoseconds,
or three minutes no matter the amount of data in the set.
